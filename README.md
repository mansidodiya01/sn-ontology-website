# Surya Namaskar Ontology

## About
The Surya Namaskar Ontology represents Surya Namaskar using three main concepts: **Asana**, **Pose**, and **Variant**.  
An **Asana** represents the yoga posture itself, a **Pose** represents its numbered occurrence within a sequence, and a **Variant** represents a specific Surya Namaskar tradition.  

The ontology supports semantic querying of:
- sequence order of poses
- repeated and inverse poses
- support type and laterality
- mantra and chakra information
- common asanas across variants
